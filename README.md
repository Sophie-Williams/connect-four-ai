# connect-four-ai
Bots for connect four game, using Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search.

The minimax version was a submission to a Hackerearth contest (https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/battle-of-bots-3/problems/).

The second version, using Monte Carlo Tree Search (https://jeffbradberry.com/posts/2015/09/intro-to-monte-carlo-tree-search/), is an improvement over the minimax version.
